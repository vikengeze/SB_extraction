SB_extraction and SB_extraction_split are scripts to extract relevant information out of some base files
The files are pretty much the same, except the split file functions for each extraction are separate 

Samples.csv contains customer codes we want to extract information about

customer.csv contains customer info

invoice.csv contains invoice information for each customer

invoice_item.csv contains invoice item information for each invoice
